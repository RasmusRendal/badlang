# My implementation of a very bad language

This language is not useful for anything, it does not have a spec, and it will most probably never have one
It's pure learn-by-doing on my part.

## Roadmap
 - [x] Print "hello world"
 - [x] Print integers
 - [x] Do addition
 - [x] Have procedures
 - [x] Give procedures arguments
 - [ ] Add a contextual analysis phase, with exclusive access to the symbol table
 - [ ] If statements
 - [ ] While loops
 - [ ] For loops
 - [ ] Improved string datatype
